==  Introduction

Climate change, environmental degradation and invasive species represent imminent threats to biodiversity. Effective biodiversity management and policy decisions urgently require access to timely, accurate, and reliable information on biodiversity status, trends, and threats. Unprecedented amounts of biodiversity data are being accumulated from diverse sources, aided by emerging technologies such as automatic sensors, eDNA, and satellite tracking. However, the process of data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis is often time-consuming, convoluted, laborious, and irreproducible. Biodiversity monitoring across large areas and projects faces challenges in evaluating data completeness and sampling bias.

To address these challenges, the development of tools and infrastructure is crucial for meaningful interpretations and deeper understanding of biodiversity data. Furthermore, a significant delay exists in converting biodiversity data into actionable knowledge. Efforts have been made to reduce this lag through data standardization, rapid mobilization of biodiversity observations, digitization of collections, and streamlined workflows for data publication. However, delays still occur in the analysis, publication, and dissemination of data.

The B-Cubed project proposes solutions to overcome these challenges. One of those is extending and implementing the intermediary data product “occurrence cube” (Oldoni et al. 2020), which aggregates species occurrence data along spatial, temporal and/or taxonomic dimensions. The idea of creating aggregated biodiversity “data cubes” with taxonomic, spatial and temporal dimensions has also been proposed within the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEOBON) (Kissling et al. 2017) to deliver Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV). This document specifies the properties of such occurrence cubes. It also documents the requirements for software to produce such cubes and a service to deliver those in a way that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). The software and service will be implemented and provided by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).

By leveraging aggregated occurrence cubes as analysis-ready biodiversity datasets, we aim to enhance comprehension and reduce barriers to accessing and interpreting biodiversity data. Automation of workflows will provide regular and reproducible indicators and models that are open and useful to users. Additionally, the use of cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, and collaborative opportunities for applying advanced data science techniques anywhere. Finally, close collaboration with stakeholders will inform us of the requirements for tools, increase impact, and facilitate the flow of information from primary data to the decision-making processes.
