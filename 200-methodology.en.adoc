==  Methodology

The specification in this document are based on the concept of “occurrence cubes” as described in Oldoni et al. (2020). We expanded those to meet the requirements of the B-Cubed project partners and to describe a cube production service to be hosted by GBIF. Feedback was gathered from B-Cubed project partners in the kick-off meeting (13-14 March 2023), two online calls (24 and 27 April 2023) and a document open for comments.

Where possible, the specification builds on infrastructure and services already provided by GBIF (e.g. occurrence processing, occurrence search, download service, etc.).

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[RFC 2119].
