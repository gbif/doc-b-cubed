==  Cube specification

===  Dimensions

Dimensions define how occurrences are grouped into a combination of categories, similar to the GROUP BY clause in SQL. A combination of dimension categories is called a “group”, e.g. taxon _X_, year _Y_ and grid cell _Z_ is a group.

. A cube MUST have at least one dimension.
. A cube MUST at maximum have a number of groups that is equal to the number of dimensions multiplied by the number of categories per dimension.
. Groups without any associated occurrences MUST NOT be included in the cube, to ensure a user won't unwittingly assume this represents a statement of species absence. A cube will therefore typically contain (far) less groups than are theoretically possible.

====  Taxonomic

The taxonomic dimension groups occurrences into categories using their taxonomic information, i.e. “what was observed?”. Relevant terms are scientificName, kingdom, and terms derived from species matching with the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (GBIF Secretariat 2022). Grouping is especially useful to lump synonyms and child taxa.

. This dimension MUST be optional.
. A number of categories MUST be supported (see <<taxonomic-categories>> for details). All of these are existing occurrence properties (https://api.gbif.org/v1/occurrence/4021976280[example]). They are added automatically by the GBIF occurrence processing pipeline, when matching an occurrence to the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (GBIF Secretariat 2022).
.. The category speciesKey SHOULD be selected by default.
.. Note that the category taxonKey is different from the GBIF https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/openapi/v1/occurrence#/Searching%20occurrences/searchOccurrence[taxonKey] search parameter. The latter lumps synonyms and child taxa, e.g. _Vespa velutina_ Lepeletier, 1836 (taxonKey https://www.gbif.org/species/1311477[1311477]) includes both the accepted subspecies _Vespa velutina nigrithorax_ Buysson, 1905 (taxonKey https://www.gbif.org/species/6247411[6247411]) and the synonym _Vespa auraria_ Smith, 1852 (taxonKey https://www.gbif.org/species/1311484[1311484]). The category taxonKey should only lump occurrences that share the same taxonKey. This SHOULD be communicated clearly to the user.
. Occurrences that are identified at a higher taxon rank than the selected category MUST NOT be included, e.g. an occurrence identified as genus _Vespa_ (taxonKey https://www.gbif.org/species/1311334[1311334]) is excluded when using a speciesKey category.
. Occurrences MUST NOT be assigned to multiple categories.
. Since the values in the categories are integers that are not self-explanatory, additional columns with the names of the taxa and their higher taxonomy (see <<taxonomic-categories-examples>>) SHOULD be provided. This MAY be provided in the form of a taxonomic compendium as an additional file (cf. https://zenodo.org/record/7389450/files/be_species_info.csv?download=1[be_species_info.csv] in Oldoni et al. 2022).

====  Temporal

The temporal dimension groups occurrences into categories using their temporal information, i.e. “when was it observed?”. Relevant terms are eventDate, year, day, and month. Grouping is especially useful to reduce the temporal information from a continuum into discrete categories.

. This dimension MUST be optional.
. A number of categories MUST be supported (see <<temporal-categories>> for details). All of these are existing occurrence properties (https://api.gbif.org/v1/occurrence/4021976280[example]), albeit as discrete (year, month, day) not combined (year, yearmonth, yearmonthday) properties. They are added automatically by the GBIF occurrence processing pipeline, when processing the eventDate into year, month, and day.
.. The category year SHOULD be selected by default.
. Occurrences that have temporal information that is wider than the selected category SHOULD NOT be included, e.g. an occurrence with date range 2020-12-15/2021-01-15 is excluded when using a year category.
.. Alternatively, the middle of the date range MAY be used.
. Occurrences MUST NOT be assigned to multiple categories.

====  Spatial

The spatial dimension groups occurrences into categories using their spatial information, i.e. “where was it observed?”. Relevant terms are decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, geodeticDatum, and coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, as well as a reference grid. Grouping is especially useful to map data to other spatial datasets using the same reference grid and to take into account the coordinate uncertainty.

. This dimension MUST be optional.
. Only one spatial dimension MUST be used at a time in a cube.
. A number of reference grids and cell sizes MUST be supported (see <<reference-grids>> for details).
.. By default, a reference grid SHOULD NOT be selected, so that all options are considered equal.
. Non-gridded reference datasets SHOULD NOT be supported. Examples include Administrative areas (GADM 2022) and the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) (Protected Planet 2012).
.. Such datasets may not be area-covering and can have overlapping features, leading to misleading results.
.. Users are advised to make use of such datasets after cube generation. This also allows them more control and flexibility in choosing features of interest and how to combine these with the chosen reference grid.
. Occurrences SHOULD be considered circles or squares (not points).
.. Circles MUST be based on the point-radius method (Wieczorek et al. 2004), using the coordinates as the centre and the provided coordinateUncertaintyInMeters as the radius. If not provided, a default coordinateUncertaintyInMeters of 1000m SHOULD be assumed. Users SHOULD be able to specify this value.
.. Squares SHOULD be based on the provided footprintWKT or MAY be reverse-engineered when the dataset is likely gridded (Waller 2019).
. A number of grid assignment methods MUST be supported (see <<grid-assignment-methods>> for detailed needs).
.. Random grid assignment SHOULD be selected by default.
.. The seed used for random grid assignment SHOULD be mentioned in the metadata and users SHOULD be able to reuse it to create reproducible results.
.. Occurrences that have a spatial extent that is wider than the largest grid cell MUST NOT be included when using encompassing grid assignment (they can in random grid assignment).
. Occurrences that are located beyond the extent of the chosen reference grid MUST NOT be included.
. Occurrences MUST NOT be assigned to multiple grid cells (i.e. no fuzzy assignment).

===  Measures

Measures are the calculated properties per group, similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_function[aggregate functions] (count, sum, average, minimum, etc.) in SQL. Note that a group is a combination of dimension categories (see <<dimensions>>).

. The following measures SHOULD be selected by default: occurrence count, minimum coordinate uncertainty.

====  Occurrence count

. The occurrence count MUST be included per group.
. This measure MUST be an integer value expressing the number of occurrences within a group.

The occurrence count provides information on occupancy as well as how many occurrences contributed to the occupancy. Groups with occupancy = FALSE are by definition not present in the cube, see <<dimensions>>.

====  Minimum coordinate uncertainty

. The minimum coordinate uncertainty SHOULD be included per group.
. This measure MUST be a numeric value expressing the minimum coordinateUncertaintyInMeters associated with an occurrence within a group.

The minimum coordinate uncertainty indicates the minimum spatial extent of occurrences within a group. This is especially useful when using random grid assignment (see <<grid-assignment-methods>>). Consider an example where there are 4 occurrences for taxon _X_ for year _Y_ near grid cell _Z_ (1x1 km). Three of those occurrences are coming from a dataset with 10x10 km gridded data and have an coordinateUncertaintyInMeters of 7071 m. They can be represented as circles that partly or completely include grid cell Z. Due to the random grid assignment method, only one is assigned to grid cell _Z_, the others to neighbouring grid cells that overlap with their circles. A fourth occurrence is derived from iNaturalist, has an uncertainty of 30 m and falls completely within grid cell _Z_. It is assigned to grid cell _Z_. The cubed data for _XYZ_ would be:

* year: _X_
* taxon: _Y_
* grid: _Z_
* count: 2
* minimumCoordinateUncertainty: 30

The minimum coordinate uncertainty gives an indication that there was at least one occurrence with a high likelihood of falling completely within grid cell _Z_. This property can also be used to filter out groups that only contain occurrences that are smeared out over many grid cells (but were randomly assigned to that one). Such groups could be excluded from some spatial analyses at high resolution, but included in temporal analyses.

====  Minimum temporal uncertainty

. The minimum temporal uncertainty MAY be included per group.
. This measure SHOULD be an integer value expressing the minimum temporal range in seconds associated with an occurrence within a group. Examples are provided in <<examples-minimum-temporal-uncertainty>>.

The minimum temporal uncertainty indicates the minimum temporal extent of occurrences within a group. This is especially useful to filter out groups that only contain occurrences with broad temporal information.

====  Sampling bias

A species could be well represented for a certain year and grid cell not because it is particularly established there, but because it was observed more (e.g. as result of a bioblitz or because it is a rare species observers seek out). To compensate for this sampling bias, it is important to know the sampling effort. For most cases, direct measures of sampling effort are not available, so one must rely on proxy measures to indicate sampling bias/effort.

An easy metric is the total number of occurrences for a “target group” (Botella et al. 2020, de Beer et al. 2023), a group at a higher taxonomic rank than the focal taxon. To avoid confusion with the term “group” as defined in <<dimensions>>, we will refer to this as “higher taxon”. For example, the higher taxon for the focal taxon _Vanessa atalanta_ could be the genus _Vanessa_, the family _Nymphalidae_, the order _Lepidoptera_, the class _Insecta_, the phylum _Arthropoda_ or the kingdom _Animalia_. It allows to calculate a relative occurrence count (i.e. the occurrence count of the focal taxon divided by the occurrence count of the higher taxon). See GBIF Secretariat (2018) for an implementation that makes use of this to show relative observation trends. In addition to the number of occurrences, the number of days the higher taxon was observed and/or the number of observers that observed the higher taxon could also be provided.

. The target occurrence count SHOULD be included per group to facilitate assessing sampling bias.
. This measure MUST be an integer value expressing the number of occurrences within a group (see <<example-target-occurrence-counts>>). Note that by dividing the occurrence count by the target occurrence count, one can calculate a relative count.
. This measure SHOULD take into account any filters applied to the occurrence data, except for taxonomic filters. For example, for occurrence data filtered on _Vanessa atalanta_ (scientificName), human observation (basisOfRecord) and INBO (publisher), a higher taxon at family SHOULD retain the filters basisOfRecord and publisher.
. This measure SHOULD use the same grid assignment method (see <<grid-assignment-methods>>) as selected for the spatial dimension.
. This measure SHOULD NOT increase the number of records in the cube. For example, grid cells that are occupied by the higher taxon, but not by the focal taxon, SHOULD NOT be included.
. The higher taxon rank SHOULD be defined by the user:
.. It SHOULD either be genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom or life (all kingdoms).
.. The rank MUST be higher than the selected rank for the taxonomic dimension (see <<taxonomic-categories>>), e.g. only phylum, kingdom or life are valid for a cube at class level (classKey).
.. family SHOULD be selected by default for cubes with a taxonomic dimension at taxon level (acceptedKey, taxonKey), species level (speciesKey) or genus level (genusKey). The direct higher rank SHOULD be selected by default for other cubes with a higher taxonomic dimension.
.. It SHOULD NOT be possible to select more than one rank. Note that it is theoretically possible to provide this measure for all (higher) ranks.
.. If a taxon does not have a parent at the selected rank, its target occurrence count SHOULD be NULL.
. Other measures than target occurrence count MAY be considered, including:
.. Number of days observed.
.. Number of observers (recordedBy). Note that this value is not controlled and can lead to higher numbers than expected.
